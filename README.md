Predicting Employee Churn at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company

The regional manager, Michael Scott, is deeply concerned about the high turnover rate among the employees. He believes that by understanding the factors contributing to employee churn, the company can take steps to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
